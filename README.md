# todo

Hi everyone, 
this is a todo-list webapp.

It uses:
* Javascript (a lot)
* Webpack ![alt text](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpack#/media/Datei:Webpack.svg "webpack logo")
* HTML
* CSS
* The local Storage Object. For more info on the Storage object check out the w3 docsÂ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage

The projects that can be added are objects which store various to-do's in an array. 
The to-do's are objects as well.
Feel free to try it out. Data is stored in your browser, so you are able to save your to-do's without expiration date;)
