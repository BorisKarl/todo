# todo

Hi everyone, 
this is a todo-list webapp made mostly with javascript and a bit of html and css on the side, the js modules are bundled with webpack.. 
The projects that can be added are objects which store various to-do's in an array. 
The to-do's are objects as well. I used webpack for bundling the js modules and date_fns to handle dates. 
Feel free to try it out. Storing data is handled by using the Storage object in your browser, so you are able to save your to-do's without expiration date;) 
For more info on the Storage object check out the w3 docsÂ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
The js modules are bundled with webpack.
